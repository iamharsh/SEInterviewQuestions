When considering encryption for batch files, you have a few options. Here are some common types:

1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that is secure and efficient. You can use tools like OpenSSL or PowerShell to implement AES in your scripts.

2. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption method that is often used for secure data transmission. While not typically used directly in batch files, it can be used to encrypt small amounts of data.

3. **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older symmetric encryption standard that is less secure than AES, but might be suitable for less sensitive data.

4. **3DES (Triple DES)**: An improvement over DES, applying the algorithm three times to increase security. 

5. **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**: Often used for encrypting files and emails, PGP can also be invoked from a batch file to encrypt or decrypt data.

6. **Custom Encryption**: You can also create a simple custom encryption scheme using basic algorithms (like XOR) for non-sensitive data, but this is generally not recommended for serious use.

To implement encryption in batch files, you might need to call external tools or scripts written in languages like PowerShell or Python, as batch files themselves have limited built-in encryption capabilities.
